# IPL-Score-Predictor

### Overview
A small Machine learning project which predicts the score of the First Innings in IPL 2020
In this project I have tried to combine my basic knowledge in :
* ➔ Data science
* ➔ Machine Learning 
* ➔ Web Development


### About this project:
This project has three keys aspects:
## 1. DATA SCIENCE
    * Data collection(kaggle)
    * Data cleaning (feature engineering)
    * Feature Selection



## 2. DATA VISUALIZATION

* ####  Correlation of features using HeatMap
      (correlation is a measure of how strongly one variable depends on another.)

* ####  Distribution Plot of Residuals
      (Residuals is differences between observed and predicted values of data.)

## 3. MACHINE LEARNING
    * Used Regression model
    * Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
      And selecting the best model based on their score
    * Creating a PICKLE file of the model to be used in Flask application

## 4. WEB DEVELOPMENT
    * Frontend
        * ➔Used HTML
        * ➔Used CSS
        * ➔Used JavaScript
        

    * Backend
        * ➔ Used FLASK (back-end micro-framework)
